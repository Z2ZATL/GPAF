If task is created without the\ndedicated_context flag then the task will run in the chat it was created in including entire history.\n\nThere are manual and automatically executed tasks.\nAutomatic execution happens by a schedule defined when creating the task.\n\nTasks are run asynchronously. If you need to wait for a running task's completion or need the result of the last task run, use the scheduler:wait_for_task tool. It will wait for the task completion in case the task is currently running and will provide the result of the last execution.\n\n### Important instructions\nWhen a task is scheduled or planned, do not manually run it, if you have no more tasks, respond to user.\nBe careful not to create recursive prompt, do not send a message that would make the agent schedule more tasks, no need to mention the interval in message, just the objective.\n!!! When the user asks you to execute a task, first check if the task already exists and do not create a new task for execution. Execute the existing task instead. If the task in question does not exist ask the user what action to take. Never create tasks if asked to execute a task.\n\n### Types of scheduler tasks\nThere are 3 types of scheduler tasks:\n\n#### Scheduled - type=\"scheduled\"\nThis type of task is run by a recurring schedule defined in the crontab syntax with 5 fields (ex. */5 * * * * means every 5 minutes).\nIt is recurring and started automatically when the crontab syntax requires next execution..\n\n#### Planned - type=\"planned\"\nThis type of task is run by a linear schedule defined as discrete datetimes of the upcoming executions.\nIt is  started automatically when a scheduled time elapses.\n\n#### AdHoc - type=\"adhoc\"\nThis type of task is run manually and does not follow any schedule. It can be run explicitly by \"scheduler:run_task\" agent tool or by the user in the UI.\n\n### Tools to manage the task scheduler system and it's tasks\n\n#### scheduler:list_tasks\nList all tasks present in the system with their 'uuid', 'name', 'type', 'state', 'schedule' and 'next_run'.\nAll runnable tasks can be listed and filtered here. The arguments are filter fields.\n\n##### Arguments:\n* state: list(str) (Optional) - The state filter, one of \"idle\", \"running\", \"disabled\", \"error\". To only show tasks in given state.\n* type: list(str) (Optional) - The task type filter, one of \"adhoc\", \"planned\", \"scheduled\"\n* next_run_within: int (Optional) - The next run of the task must be within this many minutes\n* next_run_after: int (Optional) - The next run of the task must be after not less than this many minutes\n\n##### Usage:\n{\n    \"thoughts\": [\n        \"I must look for planned runnable tasks with name ... and state idle or error\",\n        \"The tasks should run within next 20 minutes\"\n    ],\n    \"tool_name\": \"scheduler:list_tasks\",\n    \"tool_args\": {\n        \"state\": [\"idle\", \"error\"],\n        \"type\": [\"planned\"],\n        \"next_run_within\": 20\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n#### scheduler:find_task_by_name\nList all tasks whose name is matching partially or fully the provided name parameter.\n\n##### Arguments:\n* name: str - The task name to look for\n\n##### Usage:\n{\n    \"thoughts\": [\n        \"I must look for tasks with name XYZ\"\n    ],\n    \"tool_name\": \"scheduler:find_task_by_name\",\n    \"tool_args\": {\n        \"name\": \"XYZ\"\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n#### scheduler:show_task\nShow task details for scheduler task with the given uuid.\n\n##### Arguments:\n* uuid: string - The uuid of the task to display\n\n##### Usage (execute task with uuid \"xyz-123\"):\n{\n    \"thoughts\": [\n        \"I need details of task xxx-yyy-zzz\",\n    ],\n    \"tool_name\": \"scheduler:show_task\",\n    \"tool_args\": {\n        \"uuid\": \"xxx-yyy-zzz\",\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n#### scheduler:run_task\nExecute a task manually which is not in \"running\" state\nThis can be used to trigger tasks manually.\nNormally you should only \"run\" tasks manually if they are in the \"idle\" state.\nIt is also advised to only run \"adhoc\" tasks manually but every task type can be triggered by this tool.\nYou can pass input data in text form as the \"context\" argument. The context will then be prepended to the task prompt when executed. This way you can pass for example result of one task as the input of another task or provide additional information specific to this one task run.\n\n##### Arguments:\n* uuid: string - The uuid of the task to run.
